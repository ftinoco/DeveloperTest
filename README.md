# Developer Test
Developer test based on TOP 10 COVID-19 CASES

### Requirements
Create an ASP.NET MVC application to display the top 10 regions with most COVID cases. Display
confirmed cases and deaths, sort the list by cases in descending.

If the user selects some region and press the Report button, the grid will display the top 10 provinces
with most COVID cases. Display confirmed cases and deaths, sort the list by cases in descending.
If the user selects some export option: XML, JSON or CSV, a file with the current top 10 will be
download.

### COVID-19 API:
 [COVID-19 Statistics API](https://rapidapi.com/axisbits-axisbits-default/api/covid-19-statistics)

### Considerations:
- Use SOLID principles, design patterns and good practices in your solution.
- Create unit tests in your solution.
- Push your solution to some public Git repository.
